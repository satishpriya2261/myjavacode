OPERATING SYSTEM


Explanation
Explanation https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security_overview.htm More specifically, your and Oracle's responsibilities can be divided into the following areas: Identity and Access Management (IAM): As with all Oracle cloud services, you should protect your cloud access credentials and set up individual user accounts. You are responsible for managing and reviewing access for your own employee accounts and for all activities that occur under your tenancy. Oracle is responsible for providing effective IAM services such as identity management, authentication, authorization, and auditing. Workload Security: You are responsible for protecting and securing the operating system and application layers of your compute instances from attacks and compromises. This protection includes patching applications and operating systems, operating system configuration, and protection against malware and network attacks. Oracle is responsible for providing secure images that are hardened and have the latest patches. Also, Oracle makes it simple for you to bring the same third-party security solutions that you use today. Data Classification and Compliance: You are responsible for correctly classifying and labeling your data and meeting any compliance obligations. Also, you are responsible for auditing your solutions to ensure that they meet your compliance obligations. Host Infrastructure Security: You are responsible for securely configuring and managing your compute (virtual hosts, containers), storage (object, local storage, block volumes), and platform (database configuration) services. Oracle has a shared responsibility with you to ensure that the service is optimally configured and secured. This responsibility includes hypervisor security and the configuration of the permissions and network access controls required to ensure that hosts can communicate correctly and that devices are able to attach or mount the correct storage devices. Network Security: You are responsible for securely configuring network elements such as virtual networking, load balancing, DNS, and gateways. Oracle is responsible for providing a secure network infrastructure. Client and Endpoint Protection: Your enterprise uses various hardware and software systems, such as mobile devices and browsers, to access your cloud resources. You are responsible for securing all clients and endpoints that you allow to access Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Physical Security: Oracle is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This infrastructure consists of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

Question 47: Skipped
Which involves a set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems?


DISASTER RECOVERY (DR)

Explanation
Explanation Disaster recovery (DR) involves a set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems. A disaster can be any event that puts your applications at risk, from network outages to equipment failures to natural disasters. A well architected disaster recovery (DR) plan enables you to recover quickly from disasters and continue to provide services to your users. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides highly available, secure, and scalable infrastructure and services that enable you recover your cloud workloads quickly, reliably, and securely. DR Concepts The first step in planning for DR involves determining the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). The RTO is the target time within which a given application must be restored after a disaster occurs. Typically, the more critical the applications, the lower the RTO. The RPO is the period after a disaster occurs for which the application can tolerate lost data before the disaster begins to affect the business. To build a plan that guarantees the recovery of your applications after a disaster and is cost effective, you must consider both the target time to recover and the tolerance for data loss. Disaster Scenarios Planning for DR requires a thorough understanding of all the possible scenarios that can cause disasters. Application Failure An application can fail Network Failure of failures in the underlying infrastructure or issues related to changes in software or hardware configuration. It’s important to include monitoring capability in your DR solution design so that application failures are detected and alerts are sent. Depending on your requirements, your DR solution can range from simply backing up application data and configurations to a fully active-to-active failover setup that seamlessly mitigates many types of failures. Network Failure For DR, consider potential network outages in your cloud environment. For example, if you use an IPSec VPN connection to connect your on-premise data centers to Oracle Cloud, the IPSec VPN connection could experience network performance or outage issues. We recommend setting up multiple IPSec VPN connections or using both FastConnect and IPSec VPN connections so that you have sufficient redundancy for your network connections. Data Center Failure An unexpected event could affect an entire data center (availability domain). In your DR solution design, plan for this kind of failure. If your region has multiple availability domains, we recommend deploying your applications across the availability domains to accommodate potential issues for a particular data center. If your region has only one availability domain, consider a combination of multiple fault domains and multiple-region configurations, as defined in the recommendations for a region failure. Region Failure A natural disaster could cause an entire Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region to be out of service. This scenario could be one of the most severe cases in your DR design. To protect against this scenario, deploy your workloads across multiple Oracle Cloud Infrastructure regions. Depending on your DR goals (RTO and RPO), you can back up or replicate your data to another region, or set up a fully active-to-active standby in another region. Previous Next
